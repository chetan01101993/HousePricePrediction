# HousePricePrediction

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The main goal is to find out the best factors from a given set affecting house price and build a machine learning model that will help house sellers as well as house buyers.
House Buyers : A third party customer wants to find their dream home with a reasonable price tag.With this study, they can understand the features (ex. location,Number of bathrooms, total_measureetc.) that influence the final price of the house.
Housesellers :  A customer  wants to sell a house and don’t know the price which he can take — it can’t be too low or too high. To assess the house price customer usually tries to find similar properties in the neighbourhood and predict prices based on gathered data.

Null Hypothesis: Predictor variables have no relationship with target column i.e price.

Alternate Hypothesis : Predictor variables have relationship with target column i.e price and we can construct model

DATA DESCRIPTION:

From the given set of features, get best features to predict the price of house.
The dataset consist of several independent features i.e predictors and one dependent variable i.e target.

 Independent Variables: Cid, dayhours, room_bed, room_bath, living_measure, lot_measure, ceil,  coast, sight, condition, quality, ceil_measure, basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, Zip Code, lat, long, living_measure15, lot_measure15 and furnished.

Dependent Variable: Price
